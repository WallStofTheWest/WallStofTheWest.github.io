                    <p> While it’s impossible to know for anyone to know the future absoultely, there is wisdom in trying to peak into future possibilites.
                        In the pursuite of wiser investing we will try to discover which sector will have the best likelihood of being a top performer this earnings season.
                        We offer you one analytical methodology that can put the odds in your favor of determining which sectors will be the strongest and which sectors will be the weakest: 
                        a form of relative strength analysis.

                        When conducting a relative strength analysis, analysts compare the strength of each stock market sector against 
                        every other sector by determining the percentage growth/contraction each sector has experienced since a specific 
                        start date in the past. We will modify this approach for simplicty but keep the spirit intact. Then we will employ a bit of physics,
                        Newton’s first law of motion — an object in motion tends to stay in motion — 
                        and assume that, barring any unforeseen events or information, the sectors that have been performing well will continue 
                        to perform well and the sectors that have been performing poorly will continue to perform poorly this season. 
                        
                        Let's outperform the stock market averages over time, by investing in the sectors that have the greatest 
                        potential for growing faster than the overall market in the long run.

                        The chart above shows a 20 year history of the S&P500 broken into its sectors. A special FAANG sector has been created 
                        to segregate stocks that are in a unique class of their own. We will narrow our timeframe throughout the analysis in order to 
                        focus on current trends, but in order to predict the future, we need to understand the past.

                                Technology: At the forefront of innovation and at the center of the Information Age, 
                                this sector is sure to continue to outperform for decades. The technology sector is a category of stocks that 
                                contains technological businesses, such as manufacturers producing computer hardware, 
                                computer software or electronics and technological service industry companies, such as those 
                                providing information technology and business data processing. While some examples of technology 
                                companies could include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) these stocks are not included here. 
                                This sector is strong with other tech companies are sure to come along with new innovations we are not thinking 
                                about today and is highly investable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Healthcare: With an aging population and rapid advances in biotechnology, the health industry is sure to 
                                thrive in the years and decades ahead. The healthcare sector is quite broad. Even a person 
                                with no investing experience can think of some specific area of the health industry, such as 
                                hospital conglomerates, institutional services, insurance companies, drug manufacturers, 
                                biomedical companies, or medical instrument makers. Also, when many industries are doing poorly 
                                due to negative economic conditions, the health industry can still perform relatively well 
                                because people still need to see the doctor and buy their drugs, regardless of 
                                economic conditions. For this reason the healthcare sector is considered a "defensive sector."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Consumer Staples: This sector is typically viewed as a safe haven during periods of market 
                                volatility or economic downturn, and have benefited from increases in volatility in the 
                                overall market. Staples companies also likely have benefited in recent years from effective 
                                cost-cutting and increased trade concerns. Further, as geopolitical and domestic political 
                                tensions rise, investors typically become a bit more nervous, and may seek short-term shelter in the staples sector.
                                Lastly, the moderation in oil prices could result in less money being spent on energy costs 
                                and more available for other spending keeping this sector robust.
                        </p>
                        <p>     Consumer Discretionary: Basically any goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, 
                                but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Bottom line is that lower unemployment means 
                                you've got more consumers who have the ability to spend. And since wage growth is only growing modestly year over year,
                                you would want to buy assets when there's the potential for a catalyst.</p>
